## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

In carrying out this project, I learnt about how to include multiple color theme modes easily with CSS variables and how to implement them using Tailwind CSS. I also learnt how to toggle between these color modes using classlist.add and classlist.toggle. I also learnt about the simple way of making a calculator app with simple javascript.


### Continued development

For future projects, I intend working on making them filled with animations and transitions. 


### Useful resources
